# 🍄 Super Mario Bros — COAL (Assembly Language)

A Super Mario Bros-inspired game built entirely in **x86 Assembly Language** as a semester project for the Computer Organization and Assembly Language (COAL) course.

---

## 🎮 About the Project

This project is a recreation of the classic Super Mario Bros game, implemented in low-level x86 assembly. It features background music, a highscore tracking system, and core gameplay mechanics — all written without the abstraction of high-level languages.

## ✨ Features

- 🕹️ Mario movement and gameplay mechanics
- 🎵 Background music (`music.mp3`, `music2.mp3`)
- 🏆 Highscore tracking system (`highscore.txt`)
- 🖥️ Built and run using Visual Studio (MASM)

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- x86 Assembly Language (MASM)
- Microsoft Visual Studio
- Irvine32 Library
